Sensor : Needs to emit brigter light because the floor is kinda dark colored:

Operating range : 0.2mm to 15mm, peak 2.5mm

LED Emitter resistor:


Sensor Resistor

September :

Forward Current : 10mA

V = IR
5 = 10mA * R
R = (5-1.1) / 0.01, 390 ~~ 400 ohms -> test result :not enough resistance

October 3rd,

R_sense: 500ohms -> 4K
  
- The resistor works as a protector to prevent the current from getting too high when the transistor track is open and it's like a short because when the track is open, your signal is measuring 5V anyway

- attached to a wood block to keep the height constant for calibration
- 200 Ohm, 4.7K, 2.58mm measured with caliper(measured the same way as in the datasheet, from the little tip in between the two parts)
- floor (600 ~ 750), natural because color isn't consistent
- tape (920(closest), 880~930)

width of tape : 18mm
